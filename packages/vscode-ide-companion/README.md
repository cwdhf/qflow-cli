# Gemini CLI Companion

The Gemini CLI Companion extension pairs with
[Qflow CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). This extension is
compatible with both VS Code and VS Code forks.

# Features

- Open Editor File Context: Qflow CLI gains awareness of the files you have open
  in your editor, providing it with a richer understanding of your project's
  structure and content.

- Selection Context: Qflow CLI can easily access your cursor's position and
  selected text within the editor, giving it valuable context directly from your
  current work.

- Native Diffing: Seamlessly view, modify, and accept code changes suggested by
  Qflow CLI directly within the editor.

- Launch Qflow CLI: Quickly start a new Qflow CLI session from the Command
  Palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) by running the "Qflow CLI: Run" command.

# Requirements

To use this extension, you'll need:

- VS Code version 1.99.0 or newer
